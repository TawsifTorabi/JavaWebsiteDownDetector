## Website Down Detector. 
This simple app can send http request to certain website URL or IP address and check the returned status code. 
It can tell the user that if that website is accessible or not, and if the SSL certificate is Invalid.

Some Websites are not accessible without https connection like Facebook.
So if we input http://www.facebook.com, The DNS Server will not resolve the URL and returns a denial. 
So in our app, it will show http://www.facebook.com is down.

This is built using a simple Jswing GUI and HttpConnection Class Object.
